#Challenge
#The challenge posed to us, as part of the Portfolio II module, is- to come up with a smart campus solution that makes use of #technology to enhance or transform the current education landscape.
#
#Problem
#With that challenge in mind, we decided on a problem to tackle- Long, messy physical queues coupled with extensive waiting #times when ordering food from school canteens. This is especially pertinent for lunch times, where entire student bodies flock #to the school canteens at the same time.


#Our Solution 
#The Concept
#We call it Eatnow. In a nutshell, EatNow is a smart canteen. This, however, is not in the sense of building an ordering kiosk #for each canteen stall, or giant, sprawling robotic kitchens. Instead, EatNow is a complete redesign of the modern day canteen.

#The typical process of a customer ordering food from our canteen would look like this-

#The customer begins by placing their order, through our web app (a PWA). 
#Once they place their order, it is immediately sent to the kitchen.
#The kitchen staff works their magic.
#Once the order is ready, the staff indicates it on the app.
#The web server then pings the robot to summon it to the chef.
