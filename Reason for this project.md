# Smart-Storage

# A smart campus solution that makes use of technology to enhance or transform the current education landscape.
#
# Problem
# With that challenge in mind, we decided on a problem to tackle- Long, messy physical queues coupled with extensive waiting times when ordering food from school canteens. This is especially pertinent for lunch times, where entire student bodies flock #to the school canteens at the same time.


# Our Solution 
# The Concept
# We call it Eatnow. In a nutshell, EatNow is a smart canteen. This, however, is not in the sense of building an ordering kiosk #for each canteen stall, or giant, sprawling robotic kitchens. Instead, EatNow is a complete redesign of the modern day canteen. This storage system in the illustrator file is the design files i used to laser cut acrylic pieces, feel free to scale according to your size. Next, the important file where most of my functions of code are to control the time and power of the motor spinning is in the file called TurnHereTurnThere.py . In this file you can find most functions to control the motor.
